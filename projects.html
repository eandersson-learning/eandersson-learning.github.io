    <h2>CNC Mill</h2>
    <p>I designed and built a benchtop 3 axis CNC mill. The catch? No machined or 3D printed parts. The only power tool was a drill.</p>

    <h2>Face Shield Drill Jig</h2>
    <p>During the pandemic I joined a volunteer group making 3D printed face shields. We were using the <a href="https://3dverkstan.se/protective-visor/">3DVerkstan</a> design which used hole-punched plastic sheets. I designed a drill jig so a full package of plastic sheets could be drilled instead of one sheet at a time.</p>
    <p>I was able to cut production time more than 90%, and I single-handedly drilled the films for thousands of shields.</p>

    <h2>Large Format Camera Lenses</h2>
    <p>Film photography is fun. And bigger film is bigger fun. I've adapted a number of large, fast lenses (usually aerial lenses) onto my 4x5 Speed Graphic camera.</p>
