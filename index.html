    <p>My new website is in-progress. Lighter, faster, and 100% less WordPress.</p>
    <h2>Professional Work</h2>
    <p>I am a mechanical engineer by education and trade. Most of my work is custom sheet metal design and electronics integration, and I am now going further with thermoforming and other plastic processes.</p>
    <p>Here's some of the things I've worked on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rackmount server equipment</li>
        <li>Digital signage installations in airports, shopping malls, and retail banking</li>
        <li>Static signage for donor recognition and advertising</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Personal Work</h2>
    Project pages coming soon :) 
    <ul>
        <li><b>CNC Mill</b> - I designed and built a benchtop 3 axis CNC mill. The catch? No machined or 3D printed parts. The only power tool was a drill.</li>
        <li><b>Face Shield Drill Jig</b> - During the pandemic I joined a volunteer group making 3D printed face shields. We were using the <a href="https://3dverkstan.se/protective-visor/">3DVerkstan</a> design which used hole-punched plastic sheets. I designed a drill jig so a full package of plastic sheets could be drilled instead of one sheet at a time.</li>
        <li><b>Large Format Camera Lenses</b> - Film photography is fun. And bigger film is bigger fun. I've adapted a number of large, fast lenses (usually aerial lenses) onto my 4x5 Speed Graphic camera. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Projects in the pipeline</h2>
    This is a non-exhaustive list of things I want to do. Most (if not all) will be open source, with the intention of OSHWA certification.
    <ul>
        <li><b>CR Box But (Even) Cheaper</b> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsi%E2%80%93Rosenthal_Box">Corsiâ€“Rosenthal Boxes</a> are a great invention. But MERV13+ filters can get pricey and hard to find. What if we used a <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/22905K743/">bag filter</a> instead? Or just bought the filter media directly?</li>
        <li><b>Rackmount Server Component Reuse Framework</b> - Lots of people out there want to make their own 19" rackmount gear. There's also a constant supply of low cost high quality rails, power supplies, and other parts from obsolete servers. However they were proprietary designs, so good luck finding the hole patterns on a set of Dell or HP rails. So let's reverse-engineer them and give those parts a new life.</li>
        <li><b>Benchtop CNC Press Brake</b> - DIY CNC plasma tables have been around for years. But sheet metal bending is still manual, unless you want to spend big bucks on a massive CNC press brake. 3D printed press brake tooling is also well-established. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-fTY5L5uu0">Rainbow Aviation</a> is onto something with their 3D printed backstop and tooling for a cheap benchtop press. But what if the backstop was CNC controlled? Or even the bending tonnage?</li>
        <li><b>ThunderScope Oscilloscope HMI</b> - I met Aleksa Bjelogrlic at Hackaday Supercon 2022 and again at Open Hardware Summit 2023. He's been working on a <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/180090-thunderscope">Thunderbolt oscilloscope</a>. Some of the feedback he received was that a lot of scope users like their knobs and buttons. So I'm going to step up and help make that happen. And because it's open source, it could be adapted for different use cases. Rackmount? Desktop? Field use? Let's make it happen.</li>
    </ul>
